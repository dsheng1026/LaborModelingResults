Modification based on GCAM6 AgLU

Experiment design:
E3: old AgLU reference
E2: including regional ag labor supply (extensive labor supply elasticity = 0.7)
E1: including labor productivity growth (calibrated labor productivity growth from GCAM7 ref)
E0: including capital intensification parameter (theta_irr = 0.2, theta_rfd = 0.1)
E4_gamma_1: extensive labor supply elasticity = 1.05 
E4_gamma_2: extensive labor supply elasticity = 0.35
E4_eta_higher: IO_E0 * 0.8 (crop and livestock only)
E4_eta_lower: IO_E0 * 1.2 (crop and livestock only)
E4_theta_higher: (theta_irr = 0.3, theta_rfd = 0.2)
E4_theta_lower:(theta_irr = 0, theta_rfd = 0)
